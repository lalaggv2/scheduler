# scheduler
Work day scheduler for employees

The idea was to offer an easy tool to keep track of your daily "to do list" by inputting task per hour and saving them in the list.

Using HTML, CSS and JavaScript

The interface is basic by design so as not to clutter the to do list.

At the top of the page is the date and hour
then you will find the hour on the left, the space for you to enter your activity or task, and a save button.

The task are being saved to the Local Storage so they persist even after refreshing the page.
